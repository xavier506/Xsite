## App description
Facebook Open Graph contains many small businesses' most important information required for acquiring new customers
A single web page may have many components, and it may talk about more than one thing.
If search engines understand the various components of a page, we can improve our presentation of the data.
Schema.org provides a mechanism for providing more detail about particular entities on the page, which could be populated automatically via the Facebook open graph API

For example, a page about a local business could include some or all of the following fields:

- Logo
- About (mission , description, year founded etc)
- Contact info (telephone, email , mailing etc)
- Location (maps)
- Business hours
- Photos
- News
- Events
- Ratings
