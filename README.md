# Xsite
WDI Final Project

## App description
Facebook Open Graph contains many small businesses' most important information required for acquiring new customers via a website, 
especially if search engines understand the various components of a page. By creating a website for small businesses we can improve the presentation and search engine placement of local businesses' data. 
This app will utilize the mechanism provided by  Schema.org a more detail about particular entities on the page, which could be populated automatically via the Facebook open graph API

For example, a page about a local business could include some or all of the following fields:

- Logo
- About (mission , description, year founded etc)
- Contact info (telephone, email , mailing etc)
- Location (maps)
- Business hours
- Photos
- News
- Events
- Ratings
